# OpenShift CCO Credential Rotation Requirements
# This file documents the required CLI tools and their minimum versions

# Core Requirements:
# - Ansible 2.9+ (for playbook execution)
# - OpenShift CLI (oc) 4.10+ (for cluster interaction)
# - AWS CLI 2.0+ (for AWS operations)
# - jq 1.6+ (for JSON processing)

# Installation commands:

# macOS (using Homebrew):
# brew install ansible awscli jq
# brew install openshift-cli

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
# dnf install ansible awscli jq
# # For OC CLI, download from: https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/

# Ubuntu/Debian:
# apt-get install ansible awscli jq
# # For OC CLI, download from: https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/

# Python packages (if using pip for Ansible):
# pip install ansible>=2.9
# pip install awscli>=2.0

# Verification commands:
# ansible --version

# Note: This project requires the CLI tools to be installed and configured
# on the Ansible control node. The playbook will verify their presence
# during the preflight checks.
